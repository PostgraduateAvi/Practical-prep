# Build Log

- Attempted to install required PDF parsing libraries (`PyPDF2`, `pdfminer`), but outbound network access is blocked by the execution environment.
- Book generation halted pending availability of PDF text-extraction tooling.
- Generated placeholder `book.md` and `book.pdf` markers so the pipeline can resume once dependencies are supplied.

## Outstanding Checks

- <!-- CHECK: Restore build once PDF parsing dependencies are installed and rerun the pipeline to populate book content. -->
